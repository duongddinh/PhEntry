<h2>Important</h2>
<p>
    To demonstrate the theme over-engineering, the program changes color frequently and has many unused/unnecessary features (just like this wiki).
</p>
<p>
    You cannot change language in this Wiki page. So your language in your program might be different.<br>
    If you cannot download anything from the webview of this website from the program, go to this address:  on your browser and download.<br> Also, feedback/bug report function will launch you build in mail app.
</p>
<p>
    The terms and conditions is here just to over-engineer the program, <br>but it is important to understand
    that the program will generate about 9-10 txt files in its current directory to store data. <br>The login here is just for fun to browse r/programmerhumor reddit; <br>please don't use your actual reddit username and password. <br>The password will NOT be sent to the server, it is stored locally.<br>
    
    That is it! you can ignore the rest of the terms and conditions.
    
</p>

<p>
    Privacy Policy is here just for fun,<br> but you need to understand that the program will NOT sent anything to the server. <br>As such, I do NOT collect any information.<br> That is it, you can ignore the rest of the Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Darkmode is NOT applied everywhere. <br> <font  color="red">In addition, Spanish-language is not 100% translated (because there are some words that are better left as it); <br>Spanish translation is very basic (I and my friend, because of school starts, don't have time to translate all of it, but you are welcome to contribute).<br>But you get the point of this over-engineered program.</font></p>

<section id = "changesource">

<h2>Change Sources</h2>
<p><font  color="red"><b>There is only ONE trusted source, which is my github source.<br>Be careful when adding sources.</b></font></p>

<p>Changing source allows modified version to be checked and downloaded without hash mis-matched error. <br> The source you add might push update or fix bugs faster than the original.</p>

<p>
    Default sources: 
</p>
</section>

<section id ="autoG">
    <h2>Auto-Generated password</h2>
    <p>If you don't know how to create a secure password, auto-Generated password is here.</p>
    <p>You can answer the question in the menu to generate password according to that. It is not required</p>
    <p>You can lie, write whatever you want in order to answer the question.</p>
</section>

<section id = "forgetpass">
    
<h2>Forget password-bruteforcing method</h2>
<p>To use this, you need a list of possible passwords that you might use for your login. <br>Write all possible passwords and store it in a txt file. <br>Then select the txt files for the program to start checking.</p>

<p>Uses SHA265 algorithm</p>

<pre><code class="language-clike">
    	public static String getHash(String pssd) {
		MessageDigest md = null;
		try {
			md = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
		} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
			wl.writeLog(e.toString());

		}
		byte[] digest = md.digest(pssd.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));<br>
		return DatatypeConverter.printHexBinary(digest).toLowerCase();<br>
	}

</code></pre>
<p>Note: bruteforcing in some cases are illegal to perform.<br> Since this program demonstrates over-engineering theme, I added this with no malicious intend.</p>

</section>


<section id = "hidePopUP">
<h2>Hide PopUp</h2>
<p>Hide all will disable method call for EssentialFunctions.popUp(str, str). <br>Otherwise, method call EssentialFunctions.PopUp(str,str) will be called depends on var bool.<br>You won't be able to hide start-up popUp because they are important.</p>

<p><i>Hide recommeded popUp:</i> hide what we think we should hide<br><i>Hide "Not show password" recommendation popUp: </i>Hide annoying popUp when you did not choose "Not show password"<br> (Showing password may potentially get your password stolen\ncheck the option if you don't want to take a risk!)<br><i>Hide not recommended popUp:</i> Basically an inverse version of "Hide recommeded popUp."</p>
<pre><code class = "language-clike">
    	protected static void popUp(String todis, String title) {
		if (!HidePopUpOPtion.hideAllP) {
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog((Component) null, todis,
					title, JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);
		}
	}
</code></pre>

</section>

<section id = "ChangingGame">
<h2>Change Game</h2>
<p>OWO, You can change the game!</p>
<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>
<p>You need to know Java<br>Download <a href="">ChangeGame.jar</a><br>Create theGame.java and start coding your game!</p>
<p>theGame's template</p>
<pre><code class ="language-clike">
    import javax.swing.Timer;
    import javax.swing.UIManager;
    import java.awt.Color;
    import java.awt.Graphics;
    import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
    import java.awt.event.ActionListener;
    import java.awt.event.KeyEvent;
public class TheGame extends EssentialFunctions {
    ....
    public static Timer timer;
	private ActionListener animation;
	
    ...
    	public TheGame() {
		animation = new ActionListener() {
			@Override
			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
				repaint();
			}
		};
		timer = new Timer(50, animation);
	}
	...
	public void reset() {
        //reset the game when user click play again
	}
	
	...
	
	public void paint(Graphics g){
       ... 
           //to use dark-mode / night mode
			g.setColor(UIManager.getColor( "Panel.background" ));
       ...
	}
	}

</code></pre>

<p><b>Dependencies: </b> <a href="">EssentialFunctions.java</a>, <a href ="">WriteLogF.java</a>, <a href = "">MainScreen</a></p>

<p>Then, just follow the instructions in the ChangeGame.jar</p>
<p>Next steps are essentially knowing java commands: <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html">Javac</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/jar/update.html">jar uf</a>, leave as it if you don't understand.</p>

<h3>Change mainScreen is also the same thing, except the code for the mainscreen is: </h3>
<pre><code class ="language-clike">
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Image;
import java.awt.Toolkit;

import javax.swing.JPanel;

public class MainScreen extends JPanel{
	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
	public void paint(Graphics g) {
		drawDabg(g);
		// can draw more here!
	}
	// Basically this draws the gif you see in the home screen
	private void drawDabg(Graphics g) {
		Image icon = Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().getImage(getClass().getResource("Nice1.gif"));
		g.drawImage(icon, 200, 100, this);
	}
}

   </code></pre>
   
   <p><i><b>You don't need any dependency if you want to change mainScreen</b></i></p>

<p>Yep, I know this is unnecessary.</p>

<section id ="alogin">
    <h2>About Loging in</h2>
    <p>You can only create 1 account only, if you create another, you need to detele your pre-existing one.</p>
    <p>When you log in, you will see the window saying welcome, [yourname] and reddit. <br> This is the webview version of the website which can be accessed <a href = ""> here</a>.<br>
       You are NOT actually logged in to reddit but, rather, just got to view it. <br>
       Your login and password are not stored on the server;<br> it is just a simple javascript to show yor username you created on the server.
    
    </p>
    <p>You can check the source code at <a href =""> index.html</a></p>
</section>

<section id ="Building">
   <h2>Building the project from source code</h2>
   <p>Use java jdk <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">8u211.</a> jdk 12 does not work!</p>
<p>run Build.bat (windows)/ Build.sh (linux, macos)</p>
<p>Prefered OS: Mac OS because this program is built on Mac OS.</p>

<p>My good friend, Benjamin Barros, for translating to Spanish. This could not be done without you <3 </p>
